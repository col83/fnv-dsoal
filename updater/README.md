add python scripts for check builds, artifact & links

generated with chatgpt in 2 days.

due to complete lack of understanding and knowledge of python, i just want the scripts to do their job, but how? - it doesn't matter.

they work. they do the job. great.

for work it is necessary - pip install -r requirements.txt
